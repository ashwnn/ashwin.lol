As the use of artificial intelligence in various industries continues to expand, one area that has gained traction is the creation of AI-generated art. From logos to stock images, AI-generated art is being used for a range of practical purposes. In this blog post, we'll explore the ways in which AI is being used to create visually stunning and unique designs, and how these designs can be used in practical applications.

## Where do I generate images?
There are a dozen websites/services that offer image generation for free with the release of Stable Diffusion. However in my experience various platforms/models are good at different tasks. A list of good platforms/models are listed below:
- [DALL·E 2](https://labs.openai.com/)
- [Lexica](https://lexica.art/)
- [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/)
- [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion)


## What can I do with image generation?
The possibilities are endless to say the least. However throughout my personal experience using AI generated images have made my life easier from generating logos for my projects to creating stock images for my blog posts. Below you can find a list of images I generated and the prompts used to generate them.

### Example Generations
| Image | Prompt | Platform | Use |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| ![generated prompt](/static/images/practical-application-ml-logo.png) | abstract modern minimalistic adult entertainment related logo with the letter "H", 8k, digital art | DALL·E | Project Logo |
| ![generated prompt](/static/images/practical-application-ml-logo1.png) | abstract modern minimalistic software related logo with the letter "A", 8k, digital art | DALL·E | Personal Logo |
| ![generated prompt](/static/images/practical-application-ml-tshirt.png) | a abstract, creative tshirt print that is related to captivation of emotions, 8k, digital art, has the letters "CPTVD" on the sleeve | DALL·E | Possible T-Shirt Design + Mockup |
| ![generated prompt](/static/images/practical-application-ml-print.png) | a abstract, creative tshirt print that is related to strings, 8k, digital art, has the letters "NSA" | DALL·E | T-Shirt Design Idea |
| ![generated prompt](/static/images/practical-application-ml-art.png) | A digital art piece called "Machinery of the Stars" which depicts a man with headphones looking up at the stars which amongst the fog has cog gears similar to a time machine | DALL·E | Digital Art |

## What are the benefits of using AI generated images?
- Fast and simple placeholders/logos for your projects. I've found that using AI generated images is a lot faster than creating a logo from scratch. This is especially useful when you're in a rush to get a project done.
- Unique and visually stunning designs, generally when I try to create a logo for my projects I end up with something that looks like a 5 year old made it. However with AI generated images I can get something that looks like it was made by a professional designer.
- No copyright issues, since you're not using someone else's work you don't have to worry about copyright issues (although copyright with AI generated art is weird).

## Conclusion
In conclusion, I hope this post has given you some ideas on how to use AI generated images in your projects. Thanks for reading!
