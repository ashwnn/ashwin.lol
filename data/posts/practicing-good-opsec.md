Operations security, or OPSEC, is a vital aspect of keeping sensitive information out of the wrong hands. Whether in a personal or professional context, good OPSEC is crucial in today's digital age, where cyber-attacks, identity theft, and data breaches are becoming increasingly common.

Here are some less well-known, yet highly effective tips for maintaining good OPSEC:

### Strong and Unique Passwords
- Did you know that using "password" as your password is still the most common password used today?
- Mix it up with a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- Avoid using easily guessable information such as your name, birthdate, or pet's name
- Create a different password for each of your accounts to reduce the risk of a data breach

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Did you know that nearly 80% of data breaches are due to weak or stolen passwords?
- Add an extra layer of security to your online accounts
- Require a second form of authentication in addition to your password, such as a code sent to your phone or email, biometric factor, or physical key
### Mindful Sharing on the Web
- Be mindful of the information you share online, as it can be accessed by a wide range of people
- Avoid posting personal information such as your address, phone number, or financial details on social media or public platforms
- Did you know that over 50% of social media users have accepted a friend request from a stranger? Be cautious and consider who you accept friend requests from
- Adjust your privacy settings to limit the amount of information that is visible to others
### Encryption
- Did you know that encryption has been used since ancient times to protect sensitive information?
- Encrypting your data helps to protect it from being accessed by unauthorized parties
- Particularly important when transmitting sensitive information over the internet, such as through email or messaging apps
- Many services offer end-to-end encryption, meaning that the data is encrypted while being transmitted and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient
### Securing Your Devices
- Did you know that over 30% of cyber-attacks are targeted at mobile devices?
- Securing your devices, such as your phone, laptop, and tablet, is essential to prevent them from being hacked or accessed by unauthorized individuals
- Regularly install security updates and antivirus software, use strong passwords, and enable 2FA on your devices
- Avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, as these can be less secure than private networks

## Conclusion
In conclusion, by following these tips and cool facts, you can help to protect your personal and professional information and maintain good OPSEC. Regularly reviewing your security practices and staying vigilant is crucial in ensuring that you are taking all necessary precautions to safeguard your data. Remember, the security of your information is in your hands!
