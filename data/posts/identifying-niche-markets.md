It's difficult to identify the most niche and untapped market because markets are constantly evolving and new niche markets may emerge over time. In addition, what constitutes a "niche" market can vary depending on the context and perspective of the observer.

That being said, some potentially niche and untapped markets may include:

1. Specialized and customized products or services that meet the needs of a very specific group of people or organizations. For example, a company that produces custom prosthetics for athletes with disabilities.
2. Emerging technologies or innovations that have not yet been widely adopted or commercialized. For example, a company that develops and sells a new type of renewable energy technology.
3. Niche markets within established industries. For example, a company that focuses on producing high-quality, artisanal food products within the larger food and beverage industry.
4. Niche markets in developing countries or regions where there may be less competition and a greater potential for growth.

Ultimately, the success of a business in a niche market will depend on a variety of factors, including the demand for the product or service, the competitive landscape, and the ability to effectively market and sell to the target audience.
