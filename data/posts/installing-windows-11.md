## Prerequisites
To install Windows 11, you will need the following:
- A copy of the Windows 11 installation media. This can be in the form of a DVD or a USB flash drive.
- A license key for Windows 11. If you have purchased a copy of Windows 11, you should have received a license key. If you do not have a license key, you will not be able to install and activate Windows 11.
- A computer that meets the system requirements for Windows 11. You can find the system requirements for Windows 11 on the Microsoft website.
- A blank DVD or USB flash drive with at least 4 GB of free space. This will be used to create the Windows 11 installation media.

## Installation
Once you have all of these items, you can begin the installation process:
- Insert the Windows 11 installation media (DVD or USB) into your computer.
- Restart your computer and press the appropriate key to enter the BIOS or UEFI settings. This key is usually Del, F2, or F12, but it may vary depending on your computer's manufacturer.
- In the BIOS or UEFI settings, locate the boot order settings and set the boot priority to boot from the installation media first. Save your changes and exit the BIOS or UEFI settings.
- Your computer will now boot from the installation media. Follow the on-screen instructions to begin the installation process.
- When prompted, enter your license key to activate Windows 11. If you do not have a license key, you will not be able to continue with the installation.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. This may include selecting a partition to install Windows 11 on, choosing optional features to install, and setting up a user account.
- Once the installation is complete, your computer will restart and boot into the newly installed version of Windows 11. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process and start using Windows 11.
